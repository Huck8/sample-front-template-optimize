        Stoicism is an ancient philosophy that originated in ancient Greece and
        remains relevant today. Stoics believe in the importance of living
        according to reason and virtue, and in the idea that suffering and
        negative emotions can be overcome through self-discipline and wisdom.
        One of the fundamental ideas of Stoicism is that we cannot control what
        happens in the external world, but we can control our response to those
        events. Stoics believe that we can choose how we react to the things
        that happen to us, and that we can learn to be happy even in the most
        difficult situations.
